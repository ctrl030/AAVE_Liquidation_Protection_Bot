This folder contains ABI definitions of implementation contracts downloaded from etherscan.io.
These may be used to create web3.eth.Contract instances that can be interacted with in Javascript
tests. Those web3.eth.Contract instances provide an interface to adressable contracts that live on
the chain, i.e., ones that are forked from mainnet for testing.
